# Deployment using CDK

## Infrastructure

Project is hosted by Scaleway, provisioning is done via Terraform with CDK.

### Manual operations

* Create project on Scaleway
* Add relevant users to the projects with full access on project resources (and secret manager)
* Create an IAM Application with with full access on project resources (and secret manager) with credentials to use in CI / CD deployments
* Add your domain name, and another preview domain name, and validate it using DNS
* Add secrets to the Secret manager (you will find them documented in .env.dist), with "web" or "project" tags, depending on which stack is using it.
* Create terraform backend object storage bucket to be able to use cdk with name `${projectSlug}-terraform-state`

### Project Stack

Project stack will deploy only on a pipeline triggered from the "infra" branch and will provision resources shared between all services of this project.

* First, deploy the project stack by triggering a ci workflow on "infra branch".
* Cancel other workflows until project infrastructure is deployed
* When project infrastructure is deployed, manually validate the transactional email domain in scaleway console to verify the domain

### Web App Stack

Web App Stack will deploy on every branch and provision all resources nessecary for a preview environment or production version of the app

* Once project infrastructure is deployed, every push will trigger a web app deployment workflow !
